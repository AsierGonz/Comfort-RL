# 🤖 Comfort-RL: Reinforcement Learning for Human-Centered Robotics

**Comfort-RL** is an interactive simulation environment built in Unity and powered by ML-Agents, designed for training robotic agents that explicitly consider **human comfort** in their behavior. It enables the development and evaluation of comfort-aware policies using reinforcement learning.
