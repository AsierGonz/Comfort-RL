The environment is built in Unity, using the ML-Agents Toolkit for training intelligent agents with deep learning. Learn more at [ML-Agents Toolkit](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents).

## Realease Version Notes
The release version will feature various robotic environments generated through executable files, allowing easy and direct training with extensive customization. These environments support training agents with ML-Agents and other machine learning libraries. The first release around **October 2024** will include the following features:
- Executable environment files for testing and training algorithms
- Comprehensive explanation of the configuration, personalization, and training parameters
- Multiple environments for testing (simple tasks and complex tasks!)
- Comfort function available for agents to act according to the user's comfort level (In depth explanation on expected paper)
- Interactive environment for users to test the trained agents
- Source code available via another GitHub repository for advanced users to modify as desired
