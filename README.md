The environment is built in Unity, using the ML-Agents Toolkit for training intelligent agents with deep learning. Learn more at [ML-Agents Toolkit](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents).

## PreRelease Version Notes
The current PreRelease version provides a preview of the environment and its capabilities. It may contain minor issues during training, but it serves as an early access for users to explore and provide feedback. Over the next few months (expected updates during December and January), the full Unity source code will be provided, allowing users to make changes, adjustments, and retrain agents as needed.

The PreRelease version will also include several environments with different configurations. Some versions may be missing configuration files or folders to simplify testing in specific scenarios.

## Full Realease Version Notes
The release version will feature various robotic environments generated through executable files, allowing easy and direct training with extensive customization. These environments support training agents with ML-Agents and other machine learning libraries. The first release around **Early 2025** will include the following features:
- Executable environment files for testing and training algorithms
- Comprehensive explanation of the configuration, personalization, and training parameters
- Multiple environments for testing (simple tasks and complex tasks!)
- Comfort function available for agents to act according to the user's comfort level (In depth explanation on 10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3451663)
- Interactive environment for users to test the trained agents
- Source code available via another GitHub repository for advanced users to modify as desired
